# Custom Playables

The basic unit of `NashJS` is the __playable__, an object with a `.play()` attribute, that is called to run the game functionality. `NashJS` comes with a number of built-in __playables__, (full list [here](../components/playables/index.md)). It also comes with a __playable__ specifically meant for users to define custom functionality, called [Lambda](../components/playables/lambda.md).

But, if none of those are powerful enough to accomplish your specific use case, you can create a custom __playable__, and this guide will walk you through it.
