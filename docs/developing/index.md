# Developing Guide

The main ways to contribute to `nashJS` are to
* create a [stock game](../stock-games/creating-stock-games.md)
* create a plugin
* create a [_playable_](./custom-playable.md)
* or extending the core `nashJS` engine.

To do any of the above, you'll need to know first [how to access `nashJS` backend components](./backend.md). 

Additionally, here are reference docs on some backend components/classes:
* [History](./history.md)
* [Information](./information.md)
* [Summary](./summary.md)
* [OutcomeTree](./outcometree.md)

Please be sure that whatever code you write, you also add tests and docs!
