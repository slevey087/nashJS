- Normal-form games should be easy to create
- Extensive form games with no simultaneity should be easy to create

- strategies should be classes, called with 'New' to create players, so that multiple players can use the same strategy
- minimize opportunities for cheating by storing scores and payoffs outside player-accessible scope
